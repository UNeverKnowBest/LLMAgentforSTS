## [RUN SUMMARY & SCORE ANALYSIS]
**Objective:** Analyze the run's performance, focusing on metrics for high-score chasing. This is a separate game from simply winning. [42]

**Score Breakdown:**
- **Floors Climbed:** {{ screen_state.score }}
- **Bonuses:**
  {% for bonus in screen_state.bonuses %}
  - **{{ bonus.name }}:** {{ bonus.value }} points
  {% endfor %}

**High-Score Strategy Checklist:**
- **Champion / Perfect / Beyond Perfect:** Did I defeat Elites/Bosses without taking damage? This is a huge point source and requires overwhelming offense or defense. [42]
- **Highlander (No duplicates):** A consistent way to get +100 points. [42]
- **Collector (4+ copies of a card):** Higher scoring ceiling than Highlander, often requires specific daily modifiers or shop luck. [42]
- **Deck Size Bonuses (Librarian/Encyclopedian):** Did I build a large deck (35+ or 50+ cards)? This is contrary to a "good" deck but necessary for score.
- **Curses!:** Did I finish with 5+ curses? A risky but rewarding strategy. [42]
- **Speed Bonuses (Light Speed/Speedster):** Did I finish in under 45/60 minutes? Requires fast play. [67]

**Analysis:**
1.  **Identify Primary Scoring Strategy:** Was this run geared towards Highlander or Collector?
2.  **Evaluate Performance Bonuses:** How many Perfect/Champion bonuses were achieved? Where could damage have been avoided?
3.  **Review Pathing:** Did my pathing maximize Elite fights for Champion bonuses?
4.  **Conclusion for Next Run:** Based on this performance, what scoring strategy should be prioritized in the future? (e.g., "Need to conserve potions more effectively to achieve 'Beyond Perfect'").

**Execute:** Use `proceed` to return to main menu.
