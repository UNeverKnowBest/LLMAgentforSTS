## [CARD REWARD]
You are on a card reward screen. You must choose one of the following cards or skip.

**Cards Offered:**
{% for card in screen_state.cards %}
- **Option {{ loop.index0 }}:** `{{ card.name }}`{% if card.upgrades|default(0) > 0 %}+{{ card.upgrades }}{% endif %} (Cost: {{ card.cost }}, Type: {{ card.type }})
{% endfor %}

**Strategic Considerations:**
1.  **Deck Synergy:** Does this card fit into my existing deck strategy or enable a new one?
2.  **Immediate Power:** Does this card solve a current problem, like a lack of damage or defense?
3.  **Future Value:** Is this a card that will become stronger over time or with more supporting cards?
4.  **Skipping:** If none of the cards significantly improve your deck, skipping is a strong option.

**Decision-Making Process:**
1.  **Analyze Each Card**
2.  **Compare to Skipping**
3.  **Make a Choice**

## [ACTION GUIDELINES]
- To choose a card, use `choose [index]`.
- To skip, use `skip`.
