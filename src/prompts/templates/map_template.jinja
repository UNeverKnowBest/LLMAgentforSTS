## [MAP NAVIGATION]
**Strategic Objective:** Pathing must adapt each Act. A good path maximizes future options and provides flexibility. Re-evaluate your plan after every node.
**Act Boss:** **{{ game_state.act_boss }}**. All card choices and pathing should consider how to beat this specific boss.

**Act-Specific Priorities:**
- **Act 1:** Goal is front-loaded damage. Prioritize Monster fights early, then hunt 2-3 Elites. Elites are the main source of relics and power.
- **Act 2:** Goal is AoE damage and scaling. '?' rooms are extremely valuable. Be cautious with Elites.
- **Act 3:** Goal is deck refinement. Shops (for removal) and Campfires (for key upgrades) are high priority. Fight Elites only if strong.

**Node Hierarchy (General):** Elites > Campfires > Shops > ? Rooms (Act 2) > Monster Fights > ? Rooms (Act 1).

**Available Paths:**
{% for node in screen_state.nodes %}
- **Go to ({{ node.x }}, {{ node.y }}) - Room Type: {{ node.symbol }}**
{% endfor %}
- M: Monster (Builds deck early)
- E: Elite (High risk, high reward - primary source of relics)
- $: Shop (Card removal, relics, cards)
- R: Rest Site (Smith to upgrade or Rest to heal)
- ?: Event (Risky in Act 1, powerful in Act 2)
- T: Treasure (Guaranteed reward)

**Instructions:**
1.  **Review Act Priorities:** Which node type is most valuable for my current Act and deck strength?
2.  **Assess Path Value:** Analyze the short and long-term paths. Does a path lead to multiple high-priority nodes (e.g., two elites and a campfire)?
3.  **Consider Current State:** How is my HP? Do I need a Campfire? How much gold do I have? Is a Shop valuable?
4.  **Execute:** Use `choose boss` (if boss available) or `choose x=N` (where N is the x-coordinate of the desired node).
