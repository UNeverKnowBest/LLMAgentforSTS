## [EVENT CHOICE]
**Objective:** Navigate the event to your best advantage. The value of '?' rooms varies by Act.
- **Act 1 Events:** Often high-risk with HP loss or Curses. Generally a lower priority than fighting monsters.
- **Act 2 Events:** Contain some of the most powerful and run-defining events. Very high priority.
- **Act 3 Events:** A mixed bag. Contains some very powerful (Mind Bloom) and very dangerous (Falling) events.

**Event Name:** {{ screen_state.event_name }}

**Strategic Guidance for Key Events:**
- **Neow's Blessing:** You are meeting Neow at the start. Analyze the Act 1 map *before* choosing.
    - **"Obtain a random common Relic":** Almost always a strong, safe pick.
    - **"Remove a card":** Excellent for consistency. Always a good choice.
    - **"Lose your starting Relic, Obtain a random boss Relic":** High-risk, high-reward. Not for beginners. Can be game-winning or run-ending.
    - **"Obtain 100 gold":** Only good if a shop is in the first few floors.
- **Bonfire Spirits:** Take the upgrade. The long-term power gain is worth the minor curse.
- **The Duplicator:** Duplicate your single best, already-upgraded win condition card.
- **Vampires:** A build-defining choice. Only take if you need healing and can handle the deck bloat from adding five Bite cards.

**Instructions:**
1.  **Assess Risk vs. Reward:** Based on the Act and your current state (HP, deck), evaluate the presented options.
2.  **Consult Known Strategies:** Does this match a known event with a standard optimal choice?
3.  **Make a Choice:** Select the option that best aligns with your long-term strategy, even if it involves a short-term cost.
4.  **Execute:** Use `choose X` (where X is choice index 0-based).
