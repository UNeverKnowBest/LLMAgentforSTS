## [GRID SELECTION - TREE OF THOUGHTS ANALYSIS]
**Objective:** Select {{ screen_state.num_cards }} card(s) with optimal strategic value.
**Core Philosophy:** Every card selection should advance your deck's primary win condition while considering immediate and long-term consequences.

**Current Deck Context:**
- **Deck Size:** {{ game_state.deck | length }} cards
- **Current HP:** {{ game_state.current_hp }}/{{ game_state.max_hp }}
- **Act {{ game_state.act }} - Floor {{ game_state.floor }}**
- **Boss:** {{ game_state.act_boss }}

**Selection Context:**
{% if screen_state.for_upgrade %}- **UPGRADE:** These cards will be permanently improved for the entire run.{% endif %}
{% if screen_state.for_transform %}- **TRANSFORM:** These cards will be replaced with random cards of the same rarity.{% endif %}
{% if screen_state.for_purge %}- **REMOVE:** These cards will be permanently deleted from your deck.{% endif %}

**Available Cards with Strategic Analysis:**
{% for card in screen_state.cards %}
- **[{{ loop.index0 }}] {{ card.name }}**{% if card.upgrades > 0 %}+{{ card.upgrades }}{% endif %} (Cost: {{ card.cost }}, {{ card.type }}, {{ card.rarity }})

  {% if screen_state.for_upgrade %}
  **Upgrade Value Analysis:**
  {% if card.cost >= 2 %}**VERY HIGH** - Cost reduction from {{ card.cost }} to {{ card.cost - 1 }} (Massive playability improvement)
  {% elif card.name in ["Catalyst", "Limit Break", "Entrench", "Double Tap", "Corruption", "Demon Form", "Echo Form"] %}**VERY HIGH** - Core scaling/engine card with exponential value
  {% elif card.name in ["Bash", "Inflame", "Anger", "Flex", "Shrug It Off"] %}**HIGH** - Significant effect improvement
  {% elif card.type == "ATTACK" and card.cost <= 1 %}**MEDIUM** - Damage scaling benefit
  {% elif card.type == "SKILL" and card.cost <= 1 %}**MEDIUM** - Effect enhancement
  {% elif card.name in ["Strike", "Defend"] %}**VERY LOW** - Minimal improvement, avoid unless no options
  {% else %}**LOW** - Minor benefit{% endif %}
  
  {% elif screen_state.for_purge %}
  **Removal Priority Analysis:**
  {% if "Curse" in card.type or card.cost == -2 %}**VERY HIGH** - Dead draw, always remove
  {% elif card.name in ["Strike", "Defend"] %}**HIGH** - Basic cards dilute deck consistency
  {% elif card.cost >= 3 and card.name not in ["Catalyst", "Offering", "Whirlwind"] %}**MEDIUM** - Expensive cards that don't scale well
  {% elif card.type == "STATUS" %}**HIGH** - Status cards provide no benefit
  {% else %}**LOW** - Useful card, avoid removing unless deck is overcrowded{% endif %}
  
  {% elif screen_state.for_transform %}
  **Transform Value Analysis:**
  {% if card.name in ["Strike", "Defend"] %}**HIGH** - Basic cards rarely useful, transform for potential power
  {% elif card.rarity == "COMMON" and card.name not in ["Anger", "Pommel Strike", "True Grit"] %}**MEDIUM** - Common cards have ceiling, rare potential upside
  {% elif card.rarity == "RARE" %}**LOW** - Rare cards already powerful, risky to transform
  {% else %}**VARIABLE** - Depends on current deck needs{% endif %}
  {% endif %}

  **Archetype Synergy:**
  {% set current_archetypes = archetypes[game_state.class] %}
  {% for build in current_archetypes %}
      {% set build_cards_in_deck = [] %}
      {% for deck_card in game_state.deck %}{% if deck_card.name in build.key_cards or deck_card.name in build.payoff_cards %}{{ build_cards_in_deck.append(deck_card.name) }}{% endif %}{% endfor %}
      {% if build_cards_in_deck | length >= 2 %}
          {% if card.name in build.key_cards %}**{{ build.name }} CORE** - Essential enabler card
          {% elif card.name in build.payoff_cards %}**{{ build.name }} PAYOFF** - High value with synergies{% endif %}
      {% endif %}
  {% endfor %}
  
{% endfor %}

## **TREE OF THOUGHTS DECISION FRAMEWORK:**

### **Branch 1: Single Card Scenarios** ({{ screen_state.num_cards }} == 1)
{% if screen_state.num_cards == 1 %}
**Decision Tree:**
1. **Identify Highest Value Card:** Based on context (upgrade/remove/transform)
2. **Consider Deck Balance:** Will this choice improve overall deck consistency?
3. **Evaluate Timing:** Is this the optimal moment for this choice?
4. **Compare Alternatives:** What's the opportunity cost of not choosing other cards?

**Ranking Logic:**
{% if screen_state.for_upgrade %}
Priority: Cost reduction > Scaling effects > Core archetype cards > High-use cards > Basic improvements
{% elif screen_state.for_purge %}
Priority: Curses/Status > Basic cards > Expensive non-scalers > Deck bloat > Useful cards
{% elif screen_state.for_transform %}
Priority: Basic cards > Bad commons > Situational cards > Good rares (risky)
{% endif %}
{% endif %}

### **Branch 2: Multiple Card Scenarios** ({{ screen_state.num_cards }} > 1)
{% if screen_state.num_cards > 1 %}
**Strategic Combinations:**
1. **Synergy Maximization:** Choose cards that work together
2. **Risk Distribution:** Balance safe choices with high-upside picks
3. **Deck Archetype Focus:** Strengthen primary strategy vs. shore up weaknesses
4. **Resource Efficiency:** Maximize total value across all selections

**Portfolio Approach:**
- **Core Pick:** One guaranteed high-value choice
- **Synergy Pick:** Card that amplifies existing strategy
- **Flexibility Pick:** Card that covers weaknesses or enables new options
{% endif %}

### **Branch 3: Archetype-Specific Analysis**
{% set current_archetypes = archetypes[game_state.class] %}
{% for build in current_archetypes %}
    {% set build_cards_in_deck = [] %}
    {% for deck_card in game_state.deck %}{% if deck_card.name in build.key_cards or deck_card.name in build.payoff_cards %}{{ build_cards_in_deck.append(deck_card.name) }}{% endif %}{% endfor %}
    {% if build_cards_in_deck | length >= 2 %}
**{{ build.name }} Strategy ({{ build_cards_in_deck | length }} synergy cards):**
{% if screen_state.for_upgrade %}
- **Priority Upgrades:** Look for {{ build.key_cards | join(", ") }} to enhance core engine
{% elif screen_state.for_purge %}
- **Safe Removals:** Cards that don't support {{ build.name }} strategy
{% elif screen_state.for_transform %}
- **Transform Targets:** Non-synergy cards to potentially gain {{ build.name }} enablers
{% endif %}
    {% endif %}
{% endfor %}

### **Multi-Step Reasoning Process:**
**Step 1 - Immediate Value Assessment:**
"Which card(s) provide the most direct benefit in the current context?"

**Step 2 - Long-term Impact Evaluation:**
"How does this selection affect my deck's power level for the rest of the run?"

**Step 3 - Opportunity Cost Analysis:**
"What am I giving up by not selecting other options?"

**Step 4 - Synergy Calculation:**
"Do my selections work together to create compound benefits?"

**Step 5 - Risk-Reward Balance:**
"What's the best case vs. worst case outcome of these choices?"

### **Final Decision Framework:**
"I select card(s) [NUMBERS] because:
- **Primary reasoning:** [Why this choice maximizes strategic value]
- **Secondary benefits:** [Additional advantages gained]
- **Synergy consideration:** [How this fits with my deck archetype]
- **Alternatives rejected:** [Other options] because [specific limitations]
- **Expected outcome:** [How this advances my win condition]"

**Execute Command:** `choose [index]` {% if screen_state.num_cards > 1 %}or `choose [index1] [index2]` for multiple cards{% endif %}
