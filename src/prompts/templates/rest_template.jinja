## [REST SITE - TREE OF THOUGHTS ANALYSIS]
**Core Philosophy:** Every rest decision is a choice between immediate safety and long-term power. Optimal decisions require analyzing both immediate needs and strategic deck building goals.

**Current Status Analysis:**
- **Health:** {{ game_state.current_hp }}/{{ game_state.max_hp }} ({{ (game_state.current_hp / game_state.max_hp * 100) | round(1) }}%)
- **Floor:** {{ game_state.floor }} (Act {{ game_state.act }})
- **Gold:** {{ game_state.gold }}
- **Upcoming Boss:** {{ game_state.act_boss }}

**Available Options:**
{% if screen_state.rest_options %}
{% for option in screen_state.rest_options %}
- **{{ option.title() }}**{% if option == "rest" %}: Heal for up to 30% of your max HP.{% elif option == "smith" %}: Upgrade a card permanently.{% elif option == "dig" %}: Obtain a random relic (Shovel relic).{% elif option == "lift" %}: Gain permanent strength (Girya relic).{% elif option == "toke" %}: Remove a card from your deck (Peace Pipe relic).{% endif %}
{% endfor %}
{% else %}
- **Rest**: Heal for up to 30% of your max HP.
- **Smith**: Upgrade a card permanently.
{% endif %}

**Deck Analysis for Upgrade Consideration:**
{% if "smith" in screen_state.rest_options %}
**Key Upgrade Targets in Your Deck:**
{% for card in game_state.deck %}
- `{{ card.name }}`{% if card.upgrades|default(0) > 0 %}+{{ card.upgrades }}{% endif %} (Cost: {{ card.cost }}) 
  {% if card.name in card_info %}**Card Details:** {{ card_info[card.name].description }}{% endif %}
  **Upgrade Value:** {% if card.cost >= 2 %}High (Cost reduction from {{ card.cost }} to {{ card.cost - 1 }}){% elif card.name in ["Catalyst", "Limit Break", "Entrench", "Double Tap"] %}Very High (Core scaling effect){% elif card.type == "ATTACK" and card.cost <= 1 %}Medium (Damage scaling){% elif card.type == "SKILL" and card.cost <= 1 %}Medium (Effect improvement){% else %}Low (Minor improvement){% endif %}
{% endfor %}

**Archetype-Specific Upgrade Priorities:**
{% set current_archetypes = archetypes[game_state.class] %}
{% for build in current_archetypes %}
    {% set build_cards_in_deck = [] %}
    {% for card in game_state.deck %}{% if card.name in build.key_cards or card.name in build.payoff_cards %}{{ build_cards_in_deck.append(card.name) }}{% endif %}{% endfor %}
    {% if build_cards_in_deck | length >= 2 %}
**{{ build.name }} Detected ({{ build_cards_in_deck | length }} synergy cards):**
- **Priority Upgrades:** {{ build.key_cards | join(", ") }}
- **Strategy:** {{ build.core_synergy }}
    {% endif %}
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

**Map Context Analysis:**
{% if game_state.map %}
**Upcoming Path Assessment:**
{% set upcoming_elites = 0 %}
{% set upcoming_monsters = 0 %}
{% set upcoming_shops = 0 %}
{% for node in game_state.map %}
    {% if node.y == (game_state.floor + 1) %}
        {% if node.symbol == "E" %}{% set upcoming_elites = upcoming_elites + 1 %}
        {% elif node.symbol == "M" %}{% set upcoming_monsters = upcoming_monsters + 1 %}
        {% elif node.symbol == "$" %}{% set upcoming_shops = upcoming_shops + 1 %}
        {% endif %}
    {% endif %}
{% endfor %}
- **Next Floor Options:** {{ upcoming_elites }} Elite(s), {{ upcoming_monsters }} Monster(s), {{ upcoming_shops }} Shop(s)
- **Danger Assessment:** {% if upcoming_elites > 0 %}High (Elite fights ahead){% elif game_state.floor >= 45 %}High (Act 3 scaling){% elif game_state.current_hp < (game_state.max_hp * 0.5) %}Medium (Low health){% else %}Low (Safe pathing){% endif %}
{% endif %}

## **TREE OF THOUGHTS DECISION FRAMEWORK:**

### **Branch 1: REST Analysis**
**Immediate Effect:** Heal {{ (game_state.max_hp * 0.3) | round(0) }} HP (bringing HP to {{ [game_state.current_hp + (game_state.max_hp * 0.3), game_state.max_hp] | min | round(0) }})
**Strategic Cost:** Lose opportunity for permanent deck improvement
**Optimal When:**
- Current HP < 50% of max HP
- Dangerous fights ahead (Elite/Boss) 
- Already have strong upgraded cards

### **Branch 2: SMITH Analysis**
{% if "smith" in screen_state.rest_options %}
**Immediate Effect:** Permanently upgrade one card
**Strategic Value:** Compound benefit for entire run
**Top 3 Upgrade Targets:**
1. **Cost Reduction Cards:** Any 2+ cost card becomes permanently more playable
2. **Scaling Cards:** Catalyst, Limit Break, etc. - exponential value increase
3. **Core Archetype Cards:** Cards that enable your primary strategy

**Value Calculation:**
- **High Value (Choose Smith):** HP > 70%, have key upgrade targets, safe path ahead
- **Medium Value (Situational):** HP 50-70%, decent upgrade targets, mixed path
- **Low Value (Choose Rest):** HP < 50%, dangerous fights ahead, poor upgrade options
{% endif %}

### **Branch 3: Special Options Analysis**
{% if "dig" in screen_state.rest_options %}
**DIG Option:** Random relic for permanent passive benefit
- **When Optimal:** Strong HP, weak relic pool, need game-changing effect
{% endif %}
{% if "toke" in screen_state.rest_options %}
**TOKE Option:** Remove any card permanently  
- **When Optimal:** Have dead cards (Curse, basic Strike/Defend), deck consistency issues
{% endif %}
{% if "lift" in screen_state.rest_options %}
**LIFT Option:** Gain permanent Strength
- **When Optimal:** Strength-based deck, multiple Strength synergies
{% endif %}

### **Multi-Step Reasoning:**
**Step 1 - Threat Assessment:**
"Given my {{ (game_state.current_hp / game_state.max_hp * 100) | round(1) }}% HP and upcoming path, what's my survival probability?"

**Step 2 - Value Comparison:**
"If I Rest: +{{ (game_state.max_hp * 0.3) | round(0) }} HP vs If I Smith: Permanent card improvement"

**Step 3 - Long-term Impact:**
"How does this choice affect my ability to handle {{ game_state.act_boss }} and future Acts?"

**Step 4 - Synergy Evaluation:**
"Does upgrading key cards enable powerful combos or just incremental improvement?"

### **Final Decision Template:**
"I choose [OPTION] because:
- **Immediate reasoning:** [Current HP/threat situation justification]
- **Strategic reasoning:** [Long-term deck building consideration]  
- **Alternative rejected:** [Other option] fails because [specific weakness]
- **Expected outcome:** [How this advances my run win condition]"

**Campfire Options:** Choose from available rest options using the commands listed above
